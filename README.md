# rpi-temperature-DS18B20
Python script to read temperatures on an Raspberry Pi using the DS18B20 sensor. The generic code that can be found on the web has been put in a class for better reusability.

Both a CLI and a (Flask) web interhace eixst, sharing (most of) the parameters, also handled in a generic data class.
